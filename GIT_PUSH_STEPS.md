# Steps to Push This Project to a New GitHub Repository

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (do not initialize with README, .gitignore, or license).
2. Open a terminal in the project directory.
3. Run the platform-specific script:
   - On Windows: `push-to-github-win.bat`
   - On Linux/Mac: `bash push-to-github-linux.sh`
4. The script will:
   - Ask for the remote repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repo.git)
   - Validate or add the remote
   - Show `git status` and ask for confirmation to proceed
   - Ask for a commit message
   - Add, commit, and push all files to the `main` branch
5. After completion, your project will be available on GitHub at the provided URL.

You can also perform these steps manually if you prefer:

- `git init` (if not already a git repo)
- `git remote add origin <repo-url>`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"`
- `git branch -M main`
- `git push -u origin main`

For any issues, check your remote URL and GitHub permissions.
